## Image Captioning with Flask App

This repository implements an image captioning model using a pre-trained InceptionV3 model and an LSTM decoder. It also includes a Flask app that allows users to upload an image and generate a caption.

**Features:**

* Leverages InceptionV3 for image feature extraction
* Utilizes an LSTM network for caption generation
* Provides a user-friendly Flask app for image captioning

**Requirements:**

* Python 3.x
* TensorFlow
* Keras
* OpenCV-Python
* Flask

**Running the Model:**

1. Clone this repository.
2. Download the pre-trained InceptionV3 weights (`imagenet`) and place them in the same directory as the code.
3. Run the Flask app using `python imagecaptioning.py`.
4. Access the app in your web browser at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` (default port).
5. Upload an image to generate a caption.

**Model Architecture:**

The model consists of two main components:

1. **InceptionV3:** This pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) extracts high-level features from the input image.
2. **LSTM Decoder:** This recurrent neural network (RNN) decodes the image features into a sequence of words, generating the final caption.

**Flask App:**

The Flask app allows users to interact with the model. Users can upload an image, and the app uses the model to generate a corresponding caption.

**Further Development:**

* Implement data loading and preprocessing for training the model (not included in this version).
* Explore different hyperparameter tuning techniques for improved performance.
* Integrate advanced caption generation techniques like beam search.
* Deploy the model to a production environment for wider accessibility.

**Feel free to contribute to this project by:**

* Reporting issues
* Suggesting improvements
* Implementing the missing data loading and training functionalities

I hope this project provides a valuable starting point for exploring image captioning with deep learning.
